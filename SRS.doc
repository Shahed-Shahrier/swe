Project Title: Digital Land (App)

This software can be used by any eligible citizen of Bangladesh who owns lands legally. In addition, land office staffs and survey officers for verifying lands can also use this software.

1.3 Intended Use
The system will be used as an online portal for submitting and processing land related requests. Citizens will apply for ownership transfer and track application status. Officials will verify documents and approve or reject requests. The system assists administrative workflow but does not replace legal authority.

1.4 Product Scope
Digi-Land will allow users to search land records, submit transfer applications and upload required documents. Officials will review applications and record decisions digitally.

1.5 Risk Defnitions:
Possible risks include incorrect information submission, fake documents and unauthorized system access. There may also be server downtime or data entry errors by officials. The system will include login authentication and action logs to reduce misuse. However, it is only a prototype and not a legally binding service
